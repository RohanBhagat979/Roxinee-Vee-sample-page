            <ul>
                <li><p>In 2014 I started this website in university because y'know, I've always wanted to have a blog. I wrote about school, productivity, and tried to sound smart. I start sending a weekly newsletter.</p></li>
                <li><p>In 2017, I got into freelance writing with my first regular client.</p></li>
                <li><p>In 2018, I graduated from university with a business degree and a job … And quit a few months later to work on my freelance writing/content marketing business full-time.</p></li>
                <li><p>In 2019, I started The Creator Maker Life Podcast. I also decided that I wanted co-workers and a way to learn design on the job. So I took a part-time job at my church doing communications and marketing.</p></li>
